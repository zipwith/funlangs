Exercise: What is the type of the following function?

> h = let x1 = (id, id, id)
>         x2 = (x1, x1, x1)
>         x3 = (x2, x2, x2)
>         x4 = (x3, x3, x3)
>         x5 = (x4, x4, x4)
>         x6 = (x5, x5, x5)
> --      x7 = (x6, x6, x6)
> --      x8 = (x7, x7, x7)
> --      x9 = (x8, x8, x8)
> --      xA = (x9, x9, x9)
> --      xB = (xA, xA, xA)
>     in x6
