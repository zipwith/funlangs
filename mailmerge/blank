Dear XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,

Thank you for coming to my valentine's party
last week.  I wanted to send a quick personal
note to let you know how much I enjoyed seeing
you again.  Here's hoping that it won't be too
long until our next get together!

Warm regards, and thanks again XXXXXXXX!
Marbin
