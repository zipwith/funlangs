Code samples for Functional Languages

* Week 6

  - `IOActions.lhs`: A repackaging of some standard Haskell
    functions to be used "IO Actions".

  - `IOExercises.lhs`: A template for some exercises using
    IO Actions.

  - `WebActions.lhs`: A library of IO actions for downloading
    files and processing web pages.  (See `IOActions-README.txt`
    for further details about these files, including information
    on how to install the necessary packages to use
    `WebActions.lhs`.)


* Week 5

  - `trees.hs`: Definitions for several different types of
    tree data structure, and for a type class that captures
    common properties between them, allowing us to write
    generic functions that work on a range of different tree
    types.

  - `pathological.lhs`: An example illustrating pathological
    behavior of Haskell-style type inference.

  - `subtleties.lhs`: Some examples illustrating some subtle
    details of Haskell-style type inference.

  - `Treedot.lhs`: A library for generating GraphViz/dot files
    for tree-like data structures using a simple variant of the
    approach that was presented in lectures.

* Week 4

  - `countdown.lhs`:  Code for solving the countdown problem,
    developed in class, but heavily based on the implementation
    in Chapter 9, "Programming in Haskell (2nd ed)" by Graham
    Hutton.

  - `aug.hs`: Code for "Using Types to Parse Natural Language".
    The paper and the original version of the code is available
    at http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/aug.html.

* Week 3

  - `datatypes.lhs`: Some examples of datatype definitions
    from the lecture.

  - `bst.lhs`: A literate version of the binary search tree
    example from the lecture.

  - `Pic.lhs`: A library for drawing text "pictures".

  - `TreeEdit.lhs`: An interactive tree editor.

* Week 2

  - `group.lhs`: Some examples demonstrating the use of
    function composition to build some interesting utility
    functions, as well as an example illustrating the use
    of literate files to include commentary and sample
    outputs.

  - `say.lhs`: A little program for printing short messages
    using big characters (formed out of little characters)!

  - `fibs.lhs`: Various ways to implement Fibonacci functions,
    (and to test that they produce the same results ...)

  - `pascal.lhs`: A demonstration program that can display
    versions of Pascal's triangle, built using standard list
    processing functions.

* Week 1

  - `defs.hs`: an example showing some simple definitions

  - `composing-fractals.lhs`: a single file version of the
    fractals program

  - `fractals/`: a folder containing a more sophisticated
    version of the fractals program, spread over multiple
    "modules", including "literate" code, and using the
    GHC compiler.
