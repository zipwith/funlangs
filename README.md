Code samples for Functional Languages

* Week 3

  - `datatypes.lhs`: Some examples of datatype definitions
    from the lecture.

  - `bst.lhs`: A literate version of the binary search tree
    example from the lecture.

  - `Pic.lhs`: A library for drawing text "pictures".

  - `TreeEdit.lhs`: An interactive tree editor.

* Week 2

  - `group.lhs`: Some examples demonstrating the use of
    function composition to build some interesting utility
    functions, as well as an example illustrating the use
    of literate files to include commentary and sample
    outputs.

  - `say.lhs`: A little program for printing short messages
    using big characters (formed out of little characters)!

  - `fibs.lhs`: Various ways to implement Fibonacci functions,
    (and to test that they produce the same results ...)

  - `pascal.lhs`: A demonstration program that can display
    versions of Pascal's triangle, built using standard list
    processing functions.

* Week 1

  - `defs.hs`: an example showing some simple definitions

  - `composing-fractals.lhs`: a single file version of the
    fractals program

  - `fractals/`: a folder containing a more sophisticated
    version of the fractals program, spread over multiple
    "modules", including "literate" code, and using the
    GHC compiler.
